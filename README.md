Climate analysis leveraging sqlalchemy skills

This challenge has multiple parts:

### Temperature Analysis I

* Hawaii is reputed to enjoy mild weather all year. Is there a meaningful difference between the temperature in, for example, June and December?

*I used pandas to evaluate the data, compute an average per station for June and December, and then compared these data sets in a paired t test.
